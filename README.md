Generate cosine waves with different sampling rates (8k, 16k), and then use triangular and Hamming windows to concatenate the cosine waves of different sampling rates, in order to facilitate comparison of the differences between the two methods.

3.Conclusion

From a broader perspective, by comparing the 8k and 16k plots, it can be observed that the 16k plot exhibits finer gradations and more precise patterns. In both plots, bright yellow step-like lines can be seen, with each step representing a different frequency. Across different sets, the height of the main bright yellow lines remains unchanged, while only the surrounding energy distribution varies.

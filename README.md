# Outline
Generate cosine waves with different sampling rates (8k, 16k), and then use triangular and Hamming windows to concatenate the cosine waves of different sampling rates, in order to facilitate comparison of the differences between the two methods.

### 3.Conclusion

From the waveform results, it can be seen that the heights of the left and right plots are different because the vertical axis scales are not the same. The maximum position in the left plot is 4k Hz, while in the right plot it is 8k Hz, so the bright lines in both plots are actually at the same height.

By comparing the 8k and 16k plots, it can be observed that the 16k plot exhibits finer gradations and more precise patterns. In both plots, bright yellow step-like lines can be seen, with each step representing a different frequency. Across different sets, the height of the main bright yellow lines remains unchanged, while only the surrounding energy distribution varies.
